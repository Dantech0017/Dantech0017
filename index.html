	<p> MentorRoom is expanding educational support beyond schools and classrooms for students. We are connecting students with mentors through our mobile app and online platform. We believe that access should be possible regardless of a student's circumstances. By uniting families, 9th-12th graders, university students, and professionals, we aim to reduce the achievement gap in the U.S. We do this through an emphasis on starting with high school, including parents and families, individualizing mentoring based on backgrounds, and having weekly career and college-readiness webinars for all parties involved. We are creating an online community of mentors from around the nation to inspire, inform, and prepare more students to attend a university and pursue their dreams. </p>
